# 6-111-project
6.111 Final Project from Fall 2014 - A Motion-Tracking DMX512 Controller

This repository includes all the files for my project, all of the write-ups that went with the project, and a .tar file for a more easily downloadable project.

To run the project, open tracking_dmx.xise in Xilinx's ISE. Compile the project, and load it onto the FPGA. The 6.111 labkits are documented here: http://www-mtl.mit.edu/Courses/6.111/labkit/

The labkits use a Virtex II chip. A .ucf file and a .v top-level verilog file for the kit are available at the link above.
