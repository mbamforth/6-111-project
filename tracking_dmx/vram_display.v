// generate display pixels from reading the ZBT ram
// note that the ZBT ram has 2 cycles of read (and write) latency
//
// We take care of that by latching the data at an appropriate time.
//
// Note that the ZBT stores 36 bits per word; we use only 32 bits here,
// decoded into four bytes of pixel data.
//
// Bug due to memory management will be fixed. The bug happens because
// memory is called based on current hcount & vcount, which will actually
// shows up 2 cycle in the future. Not to mention that these incoming data
// are latched for 2 cycles before they are used. Also remember that the
// ntsc2zbt's addressing protocol has been fixed. 

// The original bug:
// -. At (hcount, vcount) = (100, 201) data at memory address(0,100,49) 
//    arrives at vram_read_data, latch it to vr_data_latched.
// -. At (hcount, vcount) = (100, 203) data at memory address(0,100,49) 
//    is latched to last_vr_data to be used for display.
// -. Remember that memory address(0,100,49) contains camera data
//    pixel(100,192) - pixel(100,195).
// -. At (hcount, vcount) = (100, 204) camera pixel data(100,192) is shown.
// -. At (hcount, vcount) = (100, 205) camera pixel data(100,193) is shown. 
// -. At (hcount, vcount) = (100, 206) camera pixel data(100,194) is shown.
// -. At (hcount, vcount) = (100, 207) camera pixel data(100,195) is shown.
//
// Unfortunately this means that at (hcount == 0) to (hcount == 11) data from
// the right side of the camera is shown instead (including possible sync signals). 

// To fix this, two corrections has been made:
// -. Fix addressing protocol in ntsc_to_zbt module.
// -. Forecast hcount & vcount 8 clock cycles ahead and use that
//    instead to call data from ZBT.
